                  I've spent years building things in the digital world, but
                  photography is where I slow down, observe, and connect with
                  the real one.
                </h1>
                <p class="mb-lg">
                  My work is rooted in a quiet rebellion against the curated
                  lives we're fed online. I photograph life as it is,
                  unfiltered, unposed, and deeply human.
                </p>
                <p class="mb-lg">
                  Most of what we see today is shaped by algorithms and
                  aesthetics. But when you step outside and just watch people,
                  at work, in worship, or simply getting through their day, you
                  realize how far we've drifted from that truth.
                </p>
                <p class="mb-lg">
                  This portfolio is my way of preserving that truth. Of
                  reminding myself, and anyone who sees it, that ordinary life
                  still matters.
                </p>
                <p>I don't chase perfection. I chase presence.</p>

            <h2 class="mb-lg">Artist's Vision</h2>
            <p class="mb-lg">
              I've always felt like what we see online is miles away from
              reality.
            </p>
            <p class="mb-lg">
              The kind of lifestyle that's being pushed at us, how people live,
              how people love, what they want, it all feels staged. Like
              someone's idea of life, not life itself.
            </p>
            <p class="mb-lg">
              I think I noticed this because I used to spend so much time on the
              internet. It's easy to get pulled in, to think that's what life
              should look like. But then you step out, walk the streets, meet
              people, see them in the middle of their day - and it changes you.
            </p>
            <p class="mb-lg">
              You see the quiet struggles, the real smiles, the small moments.
              Nothing aesthetic. Nothing viral. Just life. And you start to
              wonder, why isn't this what we're shown?
            </p>
            <p class="mb-lg">
              Even people's dreams feel like they're not really theirs. It's
              like movies and social media hand people their ambitions.
              Bollywood, Hollywood, influencers, they've created this vanity
              culture where even our goals are borrowed.
            </p>
            <p class="mb-lg">
              And I kept thinking: where's the content that reflects real life?
              Where's the unfiltered, unposed, raw documentation of how people
              actually live?
            </p>
            <p class="mb-lg">
              We've been made to believe that only the extraordinary is worth
              showing. But I think the ordinary, the genuinely ordinary, is
              where truth lives.
            </p>
            <p class="mb-lg">
              That's what this portfolio is about. A quiet rebellion against the
              curated, the performative, the over-polished.
            </p>
            <p class="mb-lg">Just people. Working, worshiping, living.</p>
            <p>This is what I see. This is why I do this.</p>
